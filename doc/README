PLANster is a free software which allows you to coordinate virtually anything
(meetings, events, food taste, ...) with your friends.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

In order to run PLANster, you'll need to have the ADOdb Database Abstraction
Library for PHP installed on your system. That library can be downlaoded from
http://adodb.sourceforge.net/ (tried with version 4.52).

Some kind of database which is supported by ADOdb (tried with MySQL 4.1).


INSTALLATION
------------

When ADOdb is installed, change to PLANster's config directory, rename
site.conf.php-dist to site.conf.php and configure your database connection in
there.

Now, go back to PLANster's main folder, edit setup.php and comment the line
which says "die('Site already configured');". Afterwards, call setup.php in
your browser. The script will check whether the smarty template compile
directory is writable, whether ADOdb is installed and whether you database
connection works. If everything is OK, click "Initialize database" to have the
db layout created. Don't forget to remove the setup.php script afterwards or at
least reactive the "die(..)" line mentioned above - otherwise anyone will be
able to reset your database.

Now, if you'd like to import the demo-events, use the demo.sql script which
can be found in this directory. Either just copy & paste its contents into
your favourite db frontend (eg. phpmyadmin), or use a command-line database
client (for mysql: mysql YOUR_DATABASE < demo.sql).

That's it.
