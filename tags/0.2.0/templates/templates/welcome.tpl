				<h2>What is this?</h2>
				PLANster is a free online tool which allows you to coordinate virtually anything (meetings, events, food taste etc.) with your friends.
				<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
				All you need to do is <a href="register.php">register a new event</a>. Afterwards, you will be told a web-address which leads directly to your event. If you would like to try it before, there are two demos available: <a href="show.php?id=demo1">A vacation</a> and <a href="show.php?id=demo2">a meal</a>.
				<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
				Write to questions at planster dot net. Programmers interested in the inner workings can also grab <a href="http://tools.desire.ch/planster/">the full source code</a>. 
				If you experience problems with PLANster, please use the <a href="http://bugs.buzzernet.net/?project=9">bug tracker</a> to report them.
