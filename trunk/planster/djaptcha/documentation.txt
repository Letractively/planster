=== A Django Captcha ===

Yes, I know the name is not nice, but anyway you can change the name :)
It's licensed under the DWYWL (Do Whatever You Want License) you can modify the code to build weapons of mass destruction, turn it into an SUV, obliretare it, charge a bazillion dollars, anything you want.

It provides a way to create custom Captcha requests and validate them, and also:
  - An expiration timeout you can change as you wish
  - An UID for each request
  - A request model you can change as you wish. 
  - A function to remove all expired requests.
  - A view that renders the captcha text into a JPEG image.

It does not do:
  - Set the image size according to the text size. That's a TODO.
  - Cache request images. Requests aren't used twice, so that would be useless.

I'm currently under 

The provided captcha method (in djaptchatests) is a simple sum of one-digit numbers, with a 15-minute expiration timeout.

To use Djaptcha, you will need:
  - Python (oh, really?)
  - Django 0.95 or later
  - PIL. Unfortunately I couldn't make Djaptcha work in OSX, because of issues with FreeType.
